## Description

The Work Day Scheduler is a dynamic, daily work planner that helps the user to manage their time efficiently. The application allows the user to keep track of their days and scheduled events - with the current day being displayed at the top of the page - by inserting their tasks into the text area of each time block (from 9 AM to 5 PM) and clicking on the save icon to keep their multiple tasks on the page. The application is also color coded, so that the user can keep track of their scheduled tasks of the past (light pink), of the present (dark pink), and of the future (green).

The Work Day Scheduler features dynamically updated HTML, CSS powered by jQuery, and the Moment.js library to work with the date and time.
