# Work Day Scheduler

# Description
    The client wanted a daily work planner that they could add events to as they had a busy schedule and wanted a way to manage their time efficiently. Given the criterion of the work request, I created a dynamic work day scheduler that allowed the client to keep track of their days and events (the current day is displayed at the top of the page!) by inserting their tasks into the text area of each time block (from 9 AM to 5 PM) and clicking on the save icon to keep their multiple tasks on the page. I also color coded the work day scheduler, so that the client could keep track of what scheduled tasks were in the past (light pink), present (dark pink), and future (green).
